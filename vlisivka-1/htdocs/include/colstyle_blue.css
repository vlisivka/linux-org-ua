/* Blue'ish colours styles */

/*
with the styleswitcher in this theme we mainly need to override/modify 
those attributes which influence colours, like color, background-color 
and background-image.. although it's possible to alter any other rule here,
lets keep these alternative stylesheets relatively small and easy to work with.

Because this stylesheet is not suppose to override the default style.css yet
we can just leave a single empty rule here..
(some browsers dont like totally empty external css files)
